      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://benpurvis42.github.io/publication/three-pillars-of-sustainability/&#34;&gt;2019 paper&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote about the conceptual origins, or lack thereof, of the popular &amp;lsquo;three pillars&amp;rsquo; paradigm of sustainability, comprising of environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Here it was argued that rather than having a single, rigorously conceived origin and underlying theory, this perspective emerged out of the early sustainability literature from twin critiques of the economic status quo from environmental and social perspectives. This is often visualised as a Venn diagram, or more accurately three intersecting circles representing each individual pillar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the three pillars themselves, the origins of this diagram are not popularly known or acknowledged; it is typically taken as a given with little critical consideration to its implied meaning. This diagram appears to have originated initially from Barbier&amp;rsquo;s 1987 paper 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892900011449&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where it was used to argue that three systems, ecological, economic, and social are integral for consideration in any development process. Here each system is ascribed goals: “genetic diversity, resilience, biological productivity”; “satisfying basic needs (reducing poverty), equity-enhancing, increasing useful goods and services”; and “cultural diversity, institutional sustainability, social justice, participation”, respectively. “The general objective of sustainable economic development, then, is to maximize the goals of all these systems through an adaptive process of trade-offs” (p104). Barbier later describes this diagram as &amp;ldquo;infamous&amp;rdquo; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1477-8947.2011.01397.x&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;(Barbier 2011)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst this figure is typically described as a Venn diagram, it often lacks the strict logical properties of one. The diagram reproduced below has been 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability#Three_dimensions_of_sustainability&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;displayed on Wikipedia since 2006&lt;/a&gt;, and labels intersections as &amp;lsquo;bearable&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;equitable&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;viable&amp;rsquo;. Whilst the Wikipedia article references these to a 2006 report, these intersection labels are absent. So where did they come from, what is the theory behind these labels? The insidious nature of Wikipedia as a source for &amp;lsquo;established knowledge&amp;rsquo; means these terms have seeped into the sustainability literature without any attributed source or meaning (simply Google &amp;ldquo;viable equitable bearable&amp;rdquo; for countless examples). In places this is even referenced to Dreo (2006), User:Nojhan, the original contributor in the Wikipedia article. Dreo&amp;rsquo;s 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sustainable_development.svg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;image itself&lt;/a&gt; attributes its source as a translation from an 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Developpement_durable.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;equivalent diagram present on French Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. This translation of &lt;em&gt;vivable&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;equitable&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;viable&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/vivable&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;explains why&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lsquo;liveable&amp;rsquo; is often seen in place of &amp;lsquo;bearable&amp;rsquo; in some quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These labels may derive from a 2000 report by Rouxel and Rist 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.fr/d%C3%A9veloppement-durable-m%C3%A9thodologique-diagnostics-territoriaux/dp/B000WVENSW&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;where it appears on the cover&lt;/a&gt;, however I have been unable to obtain a copy of this, and my reliance on translation tools presents a barrier for understanding. Whatever the source of these terms, contemporary use appears to be detached from any underlying theory. Their unsourced, and unelaborated presence on Wikipedia remains problematic in perpetuating this typology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;Venn diagram&amp;rsquo; is routinely criticised in the literature. In presenting each circle as equal sized, the implication is that each system or set of goals holds equal importance. Not only does this mask underlying ideology, but if we are to subscribe to the &amp;lsquo;balancing of trade-offs&amp;rsquo; description of the pillars, it produces scenarios where only tangibly related economic goals may be pursued at the expense of ecological or social aspects. It is for this reason that an alternate conception of three &amp;lsquo;nested&amp;rsquo; circles may also be seen, emphasising the reliance of systems upon each other. The origins of this diagram too our unclear, although a very early version may be found (again in French) in René Passet&amp;rsquo;s 1979 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/L_%C3%89conomique_et_le_vivant.html?id=4RFOAQAAIAAJ&amp;amp;redir_esc=y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;L&amp;rsquo;Économique et le vivant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unclear origins of these diagrams, and their mainstreaming within the literature as unsourced and unelaborated is problematic. Whilst often authors provide their own meaning, it is common to see them uncritically accepted and perpetuated without consideration of the underlying ideology behind them. It is important to emphasise sustainability as ideological and the synthesis of mainstream economic discourses into it as a key component should be resisted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Limits to Growth</title>
      <link>https://benpurvis42.github.io/post/limits-to-growth/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the 2nd of March 1972, at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. Dennis Meadows led a symposium which presented the public launch of 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.donellameadows.org/wp-content/userfiles/Limits-to-Growth-digital-scan-version.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Limits to Growth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The zeitgeist of the time is captured by Hunter S. Thompson&amp;rsquo;s 1971 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1074-strange-memories-on-this-nervous-night-in-las-vegas-five&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;wave speech&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; which describes the loss of momentum of the radical and counterculture movements of the 1960s. President Richard Nixon has just returned from an 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon%27s_1972_visit_to_China&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;unprecedented diplomatic visit to China&lt;/a&gt;, and in Europe, negotiations are in their late stages for the first enlargement of the European Communities 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_enlargement_of_the_European_Communities&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;to welcome Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. At this time of increased global cooperation, the eyes of the world&amp;rsquo;s press briefly turned towards Meadows et al&amp;rsquo;s dire predictions for the future of global society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report detailed the results of a 
&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;system dynamics&lt;/a&gt; model, 
&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;World3&lt;/a&gt;, commisioned by the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://clubofrome.org/about-us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Club of Rome&lt;/a&gt;, and developed by a team of 17 scholars based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The model simulated the interaction and feedback between five subsystems representing global population, capital, agriculture, non-renewable resources, and pollution. Several scenarios were illustrated, starting from the business as usual &amp;lsquo;standard run&amp;rsquo; (reproduced below), through to scenarios where technology and policy is implemented to avert global crises. The authors used these scenarios to illustrate their central argument that unless action is taken to address present growth trends, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;the most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; (Meadows et al 1972, p23).&lt;/p&gt;

Reproduction of the &#39;standard run&#39; from _The Limits to Growth_, 1972 (p124). This scenario assumes no major change in policy takes place. Consequently diminishing resources cause a downturn in industrial growth, which leads to declining food resources and medical supplies and a consequent decline in global population.
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial response to the report was largely negative. Economist 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics/news/2020/apr/remembering-professor-wilfred-beckerman-0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wilfred Beckerman&lt;/a&gt; described the report as &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;a brazen, impudent piece of nonsense&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and devoted his inaugral lecture at University College London to attacking it (The Economist, 3 June 1972, p78). A 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/02/archives/the-limits-to-growth-a-report-for-the-club-of-romes-project-on-the.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;piece in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; by several Columbia University economists described it as as &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;a rediscovery of the oldest maxim of computer science: Garbage In, Garbage Out&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/ealr/vol5/iss1/8/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Walter Hecox (1976)&lt;/a&gt; has argued that the decision to release the model results in the accessible format of &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Limits to Growth&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;, two years before the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qCjKz8S_VKIC&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;full technical report&lt;/a&gt; was released diluted its scientific impact. The immediate response then was primarily informed by underlying prejudices rather than a detailed examining of Limits to Growth and the World3 model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugo Bardi claims that criticism of LtG peaked in the 1990s based upon claims that the collapse predicted by the model had failed to materialise (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781441994158&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bardi 2011&lt;/a&gt;, p2). In fact, even the &amp;lsquo;standard run&amp;rsquo;, presented above, carries through on a smooth trajectory into the first couple of decades of the 21st century. Thus whilst there are genuine criticisms to be made about the model and report, it seems a large portion of this criticism is based upon misrepresentation or misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of decades opinion on the study seems to have shifted in a more positive direction, with numerous studies maintaining its validity. This uptake in interest may have been buoyed by the World3 model becoming more widely available through 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://metasd.com/2010/04/world3-03/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;dissemination on the web&lt;/a&gt; as well as 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://vensim.com/free-download/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;free system dynamics software packages&lt;/a&gt; being available for running it. Numerous studies now exist relating to the discourse surrounding the report and model (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781441994158&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bardi 2011&lt;/a&gt;; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11625-015-0308-6?shared-article-renderer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gómez-Baggethun and Naredo 2015&lt;/a&gt;; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1989028&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eastin et al. 2011&lt;/a&gt;), and more technical aspects surrounding the World3 model itself (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/7/8/9864/htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Pasqualino et al. 2015&lt;/a&gt;; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421518303562?via%3Dihub&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ansell and Cayzer 2018&lt;/a&gt;). With the establishment of the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://limits2growth.org.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;‘All Party Parliamentary Group on the Limits to Growth’&lt;/a&gt; in the UK in 2016, it is clear that Limits to Growth and World3 maintain a clear relevance to contemporary research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interest in the Limits to Growth comes first from a modelling perspective, in particular the relevance of the model today and its potential as a base for adaptation. I am also interested in what we can learn from the initial negative reception. Whilst numerous authors have argued that much of the original citicism was based upon misunderstanding and misrepresentation, I believe this can act as a learning point. It is clear that some of this criticism was made in bad faith, but how much did the presentation of the first Limits to Growth report contribute to this outcome?&lt;/p&gt;
