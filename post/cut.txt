I wanted then to reflect upon my own 'undisciplinary journey'. The UK education system forces specialisation at an early age. Having studied an array of subjects, at 16 the pupil is made to narrow these down to a selection of 4, and encouraged to drop down to 3 the following year. [] widely assumed that the student will choose one of these, or a closely related subject, to study at university. At 16 there were several subjects I enjoyed, of these, my family background meant there was no question of taking Art forward, this left Physics and History as divergent paths of future specialisation. It was too early for me to pick one of these and gear my other options around it, so I picked both, supplementing them with a physics biased [] of Maths and Chemistry. My final choice was ultimatley made for me by my sub-optimal exam performance in History, essay based exams were not part of my skillset. It was thus that I came to be enrolled in a Physics undergraduate degree.
